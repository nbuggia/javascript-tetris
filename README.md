Basic implementation of tetris in JavaScript. This is my holiday project over 
Christmas 2016. It is a simple project to get more experience working with 
JavaScript in the browser. 

Todo list:
[ ] Implement in electron app shell (https://medium.com/developers-writing/building-a-desktop-application-with-electron-204203eeb658#.dr5oxscve)


Following are my notes from the experience:
* Object oriented syntax is different in JavaScript vs other languages in the C 
family. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
* The debugging tools within Chrome are great. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/
* The JavaScript ecosystem is vast: https://medium.com/@bojzi/overview-of-the-javascript-ecosystem-8ec4a0b7a7be#.5cjn4v8eg.
