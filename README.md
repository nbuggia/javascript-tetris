Basic implementation of tetris in JavaScript. This is my holiday project over 
Christmas 2016. It is a simple project to get more experience working with 
JavaScript in the browser. 

Following are my notes from the experience:
* Object oriented syntax is different in JavaScript vs other languages in the C 
family. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
* The debugging tools within Chrome are great. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/
